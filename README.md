# Industrial Energy Device Site Layout Webpage
This project aims to create a webpage that allows users to mockup the build of materials and site layout of an Industrial Energy Device site. The main goal is to design an intuitive user interface that enables the customer to configure the assembly of batteries and transformers according to their preferences.

## Battery Types and Properties

There are four different types of batteries and one transformer available:

1. **Megapack 2XL:**
   - Dimension: 40FT x 10FT
   - Energy Density: 4 MWh
   - Cost: $120,000
   - Release Date: 2022

2. **Megapack 2:**
   - Dimension: 30FT x 10FT
   - Energy Density: 3 MWh
   - Cost: $80,000
   - Release Date: 2021

3. **Megapack:**
   - Dimension: 30FT x 10FT
   - Energy Density: 2 MWh
   - Cost: $50,000
   - Release Date: 2005

4. **Powerpack:**
   - Dimension: 10FT x 10FT
   - Energy Density: 1 MWh
   - Cost: $20,000
   - Release Date: 2000

5. **Transformer:**
   - Dimension: 10FT x 10FT
   - Energy Density: -0.25MWh
   - Cost: $10,000
   - Release Date: -

## Functionality

The webpage should provide the following functionality:

1. **Battery Configuration:** Users should be able to enter the number of each type of battery they require. Upon entering the quantities and clicking calculate, the UI should dynamically display the total price, land dimension required, and the site's energy density based on the user's configuration.

2. **Transformer Requirement:** For every four industrial batteries purchased, one transformer is needed. The webpage should automatically calculate and display the required number of transformers based on the user's battery configuration.

3. **Auto-generated Site Layout:** The UI should include an autogenerated layout that visually represents the arrangement of batteries based on the user's configuration. The layout should provide an intuitive visualization of how the batteries will be positioned on the site.

4. **Width Limitation:** It is important to note that the site layouts should not exceed 100ft in width. The webpage should enforce this limitation and ensure that the generated site layouts adhere to the specified width constraint.

## Usage

For the best experience, it is recommended to run the website on a monitor with a resolution of 1920 x 1080.

To use the Industrial Energy Battery Site Layout Webpage, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Device Info" button to access detailed information about the available devices. This will provide you with the necessary knowledge to make informed decisions during the configuration process.
2. After reading the device information, click on the "Test" button to scroll down to the configuration and layout section.
3. In the configuration section, input your desired battery configuration by specifying the quantity of each device type.
4. Click the "Calculate" button to generate the corresponding results, including the total price, land dimension required, and the site's energy density based on your configuration.

Please note that the website's responsiveness and layout may vary on different screen sizes and resolutions.
